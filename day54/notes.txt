Day 54: Work on request validation with middleware.

1.Middleware is a function that has access that req, and res onjects, and the next() function.
-> exectute any code
-> modify the req and res objects
-> end request-response cycle
-> call the next middleware in the stack

2.Why is Request Validation Important
-> Prevent Invalid Data
-> Improves Security
-> Enhances User Experience

Best Practices
1.Keep Middleware Modular: Create separate files for reusable middleware.
2.Use Libraries: Libraries like Joi or express-validator make validation robust and less error-prone.
3.Provide Meaningful Error Messages: Help users understand what went wrong with their input.
4.Validate Both Client and Server-Side: Client-side validation improves UX, while server-side validation ensures security.
