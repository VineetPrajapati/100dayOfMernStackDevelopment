Day 73: Learn to handle transactions in MongoDB.

## What Are Transactions?
--> Atomicity: Either all operations in the transaction are completed successfully, or none of them are applied.
--> Multi-document Transactions: Transactions can involve multiple documents in one or more collections.
--> ACID Compliance: Transactions adhere to ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.

## Key Concepts
1. Session: Transactions are executed within a session.
2. Commit: Apply all operations of a transaction.
3. Abort: Roll back all changes made during the transaction.
4. Replica Set Requirement: Transactions are supported on replica sets and sharded clusters only.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Transactions
1. Set Up a Replica Set
    mongod --replSet rs0
2. initiate the replica set in the mongo shell
   rs.initiate()
3. Start a Session and a Transaction
   db.getMongo().startSession().startTransaction();
4. Perfrom operations in the transaction

## Common Errors and Troubleshooting
1. Error: Transaction numbers are only allowed on a replica set member or mongos.
   >> Solution: Ensure MongoDB is running as a replica set.
2. Error: WriteConflict
   >> Solution: Retry the transaction.
3. Error: Read or write not permitted in a transaction.
   >>Solution: Avoid operations not supported in transactions (e.g., creating indexes).
